The base structure for this project is provided. Look through the project for @Implement To discover all the functionality that needs to be implemented, build an architecture diagram of how all of these things will fit together. Then create a todo list of every file that needs implementing and, recursively loop through each of them, adding functionality so that it stays true to the initial implementation requirements as well as being consistent across all of the types defined. Take as long as you need, think about it deeply, and let me know when it's done. 

All the work must be completed, do not leave unimplemented code. If you do leave TODOs or comments to finish things, cycle back round and finish these before stopping.

Do not delete the original @implement or @context comments, leave them in each file for reference.

Install relevant packages where they are really good and won't slow down the app but focus on custom implementation otherwise.

Don't worry about writing any tests, just focus on the implementation, but the project needs to build cleanly and run without crashing. Some of the files provide additional context after @context that you can choose to use or reference, especially if things aren't working, or take for information. This shouldn't be taken as an implementation plan rather just tips that might be useful. I've also attached some screenshots as inspiration for UI style. /Users/cm/Desktop/Screenshot\ 2025-09-23\ at\ 17.40.30.png / Users/cm/Desktop/Screenshot\ 2025-09-23\ at\ 17.40.45.png /Users/cm/Desktop/Screenshot\ 2025-09-23\ at\ 17.40.37.png

The app also needs a good looking app icon to be added and configured. It should follow the same style of design as the app. Additionally a status bar icon and pop out menu design that also adheres to that style.

Make sure the app builds and runs successfully.

Complete all implementation and finish the app without pause.
