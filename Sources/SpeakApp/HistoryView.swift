// @Implement: This view presents the data available from the history manager. It shows a list of history items initially in a closed state that shows a minimal overview of that item but can be expanded to show the full details, including:
// - Copying the raw or post-processed transcript
// - Playing back the audio file showing the costs and models used and associated
// It also has the ability to philtre items using the History Manager and present all of that information back here.
// When expanded, a user can also navigate through the API requests included and any other API goals.
