// @Implement: This file is the state manager for the Heads-Up display. It exposes lifecycle functions so that another class can notify it when recording has started, transcribing has started, post-processing has started, etc. It has an enum for all the states it can be in and is a state machine. It also has the ability to surface errors in any of those things and it has an internal timer that shows the duration of each step.
