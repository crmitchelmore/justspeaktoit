# iOS Migration Task List (Sequential)

This folder is the execution plan for delivering the iOS app (live transcription + config sync + “send to Mac”).

## How to use

- Do tasks in numeric order.
- Each task is designed to land as a self-contained PR.
- Do not start a task until the previous task’s acceptance criteria are met.

## Deliverables

By the end of the last task you should have:
- An iOS app that supports live transcription (Apple Speech + optional Deepgram live).
- Settings + API key management with secure sync between macOS and iOS.
- A useful “in-the-moment” UX on iOS (Live Activity + copy/share).
- A “Send to Mac” workflow for cross-app insertion via the existing macOS output layer.
