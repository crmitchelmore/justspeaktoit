introduce a block of code or member list is highly controversial. No matter which style is preferred, consistency is key. Apart from different tastes, the positioning of braces can also have a significant impact on the readability of the code, especially for visually impaired developers. This rule ensures that braces are preceded by a single space and on the same line as the declaration. Comments between the declaration and the opening brace are respected.
