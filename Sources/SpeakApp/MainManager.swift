// @Implement: This file is the main lifecycle management for a transcription session. It orchestrates all the dependencies and passes commands between them.
// It depends on hotkey manager to tell it when to start recording. Based on the config from app settings it should know when to start recording either on: "a press and hold untill release" OR "double tap until the next single tap"
// It should also depend on audio file manager to process and store the recorded audio file. This should always happen when we record as a backup and in the background even and especially when we are using live transcription
// The normal behaviour will be to pass the live audio to the transcription manager for native osx live transcription but it could be a streaming api or other at thtat point.
// This file also depends on the Post Processing Manager. If app settings say post processing should happen, it hands off the raw transcription to the Post Processing Manager and receives it back when complete.
// When a complete recording, transcribing, post processing etc cycle is complete this file should write a HistoryItem to the history manager.
// This file should use the text output to perform the output once all of the steps have been finished.
// This file also takes the HUD Manager as a dependency and calls the lifecycle events on the HUD Manager for it to be updated. 
// It should call out to the HUD view to present that to the user the hud manager should update it. And pass any error messages back to it if things fail.
