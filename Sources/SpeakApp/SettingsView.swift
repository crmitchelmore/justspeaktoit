// @Implement: This view allows management of all settings within the app settings class. Each logical grouping of settings should have it's own segment in a tab bar at the top of the view. All settings should be immediately persisted through the AppSettings class when they are changed. Break down the view in to smaller components for easier management.
// - API key management: This should save to key vault. When a key is added it should validate using an api call. Each key should have red/green indicators to confirm it's saved or not.
// - General configuration (including light/dark mode), delete any caches or audio files. Text Output configuration. Show status bar only/run in background mode but still can open the app from the status bar.
// - Transcription configuration - if it's using a live transcribe with osx native (or select an api to stream to) or if it's batch and will send the file after. And which model to use for each of those and any model configuration
// - Post-processing configuration. System prompt and temperature, model selection, enabled or disabled.
// - Hotkey management and configuration: This should allow selection of a hotkey (default should be the fn key). Probably a https://github.com/sindresorhus/KeyboardShortcuts is a good choice
// - Permission management: Call from permissions manager to see and ask for permissions and allow the user to validate easily for each one if it was correctly granted. Perhaps a test button that tries to use the permission and validates the outcome somehow.
// And then any other sections you think are relevant. This should be presented in a concise but user-friendly format.
